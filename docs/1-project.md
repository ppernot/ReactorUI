# __Project__ module

Project definition.

- [__Open/New__ tab](#new-project-tab)
- [__Save__ tab](#open-and-save-tabs)

## __Open/New__ tab

* `New project` should be checked for new projects. 
In such cases, it displays a reactor template selector:

    + `Apsis`: the Apsis photochemical reactor
    
    + `Titan`: a 0D model of Titan's ionosphere

* `Select a project` button: opens a folder selector. 
For new projects, create a new folder, otherwise, 
select an existing folder.

For existing projects, the right panel displays the full path
to the chosen folder and a summary of the project's state
(number of [Monte Carlo] runs; consistency of project's files...)

## __Save__ tab

The functionality is not active (the project's files are 
automatically saved when running the simulator).
