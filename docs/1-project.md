# __Project__ module

This is where one chooses the project to be worked on. 

A project is a folder with the following structure:

```
├── MC_Input/ : Monte-Carlo samples of the chemistry 
│   │
|   ├── PhotoProcs/ : cross-sections and branching ratios
|   │
|   └── Reactions/ : neutral and ionic reactions
|
├── MC_Output/ : results of the simulations 
│   │
|   ├── fracmol_xxxx.dat : time-resolved mole fractions
|   │
|   ├── reac_rates_xxxx.dat : reaction rates
|   │
|   └── photo_rates_xxxx.dat : photoprocess rates
│
├── Run/ : contains all files necessary for a local run of reactor
│   │
|   ├── Photo/ : cross-sections and branching ratios
│   │
|   ├── reactor : executable simulation code
│   │
|   ├── control.dat : main input file
|   │
|   └── ...
|
├── Outputs/ : output files generated by the analysis tools
|
└── Scripts/ : shell scripts for running the reactor code

```


## __Open/New__ tab

* `New project` should be checked for new projects. 
In such cases, it displays a reactor template selector:

    + `Apsis`: the Apsis photochemical reactor
    
    + `Titan`: a 0D model of Titan's ionosphere

* `Select a project` button: opens a folder selector. 
For new projects, create a new folder, otherwise, 
select an existing folder.

For existing projects, the right panel displays the full path
to the chosen folder and a summary of the project's state
(number of [Monte Carlo] runs; consistency of project's files...)

## __Save__ tab

The functionality is not active (the project's files are 
automatically saved when running the simulator).
